Q1e

(i)
Big-O of Procedure	| Time Taken (s)
O(N)	            | 1.000
O(lg N)	            | 0.010
O(N lg N)	        | 9.966
O(N2)	            | 1000
O(N3)	            | 1000000

(ii)
O(1) means algorithm performs the same number of steps no matter how many data elements there are, it runs in constant time.
obviously, Algorithm A is much more likely to have performance of O(1) here.

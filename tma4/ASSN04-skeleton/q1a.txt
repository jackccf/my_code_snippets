Part 1. The time measurements should be in seconds 
down to 4 decimal places. Fill 

List Size   500         1000        2000        4000
FuncA
FuncB
FuncC

Part 2. Write down the performance of funcA and funcB in Big-O notation



Part 3. From the time measurements of funcC, compare the performance of funcC (better or worse) to Linear time and Quadratic time? 
Suggest the performance of funcC in Big-O notation.



Part 4. Rank the three functions from best scalability to worst scalability. 
Explain your answer.

This is just the example

x + y + x * 2
Order of execution is:
1.	x * 2
2.	x + y
3.	x + y + x * 2

Final value is: 15
-------------------------------

(i)
Assume a = 2 and b = 3
a - 4 * b
Order of execution is:
1. 
2. 

Final value is: 

(ii)	
Assume a = 2 and b = 3
a + b / 2 == b + 4
Order of execution is:


Final value is: 

(iii)	
Assume a = 2 and b = 3
a**2 > b and 3 < 4
Order of execution is:


Final value is: 

(iv)	
Assume a = 2 and b = 3
a = b = not(a > 3) 
Order of execution is:


Final value is:
